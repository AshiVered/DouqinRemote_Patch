# DouqinRemote_Patch
In the Qin F22Pro, there is a built-in IR remote app (for example, for air conditioners or smart TVs). The problem is that if you root the device and remove some of the bloatware the manufacturer included in the firmware, the IR app stops working. When you try to open it, an error saying "System environment error!" appears, and the app immediately closes.

So I decided to bypass this protection and modify the app so that it works in any case.
 Full documentation is available on my blog (currently in Hebrew only).
